| Percentile       | Meaning                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P50 (Median)** | 50% of requests are faster than this value (good for typical performance). |
| **P90**          | 90% of requests are faster (useful for general performance insights).      |
| **P95**          | 95% of requests are faster (helps detect slow outliers).                   |
| **P99**          | 99% of requests are faster (identifies extreme slow requests).             |
| **P999 (P99.9)** | Measures the worst-case scenarios (useful for high-reliability systems).   |
